I really enjoyed ACT I of the Responsive Web Design Certification process, so I'm going to keep going. It seems that ACT II, which ends with the creation of a "Tribute Page", may focus more on CSS, which is exciting, as I really enjoyed figuring out the different ways to style and design when making ACT I's "Survey Form". 

As before, ACT II is broken up into four, smaller, sub-projects and one final project. The first involves 45 steps, the second 24, the third 68, and the fourth 67. My planned 50 - 70 steps a day have turned moreso into one sub-project a day, with a day or two devoted to the final project, so I might do the same here. The first two sub-projects of ACT II are much shorter than previous ones, but I don't want to get ahead of myself and start speeding through things without giving them their due diligence and the time to really settle in my mind.
